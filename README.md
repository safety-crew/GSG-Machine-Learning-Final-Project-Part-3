# Part 3: Association Rule Learning - Discovering Patterns
I've provided you with two artifacts for your machine learning project:

### Python Code for Market Basket Analysis: A complete Jupyter Notebook implementation that:

- Loads and preprocesses the Groceries dataset
- Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Converts transaction data to the appropriate format
- Applies the Apriori algorithm to find frequent itemsets
- Generates association rules with confidence and lift metrics
- Creates multiple visualizations including bar charts and a network graph
- Summarizes key insights from the analysis


### Short Report in Markdown Format: A concise summary of:

- Key insights from the exploratory data analysis
- Significant findings from the association rule learning
- Business implications and potential applications



### The code includes all the required steps mentioned in your project description:

- Preprocessing data (converting transaction lists into a matrix format)
- Applying the Apriori algorithm to find strong association rules
- Visualizing results using network graphs
